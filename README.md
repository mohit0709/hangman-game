# hangman-game
# This project uses for & while loops, conditional statements, modules and statements like 'not' and 'in' and list as a datastructure.
#This has a list which has lots of words for the user to guess if they guess  the letter present in the randomly chosen word then it gets preinted on the list with dashes inside. If all the letter are guessed correctly then the user wins and for each wrong guess the the user looses a life out of 6.
